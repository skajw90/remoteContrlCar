This project is written by Swift Language for iOS devices.

The project is about to drive a customed RC car communicated via wifi.
This app has these properties :
- To control the RC car accelerating, decelerating, and turning left and right by
clicking or holding buttons.
- To draw map by data read from calculating wheel's movement and the distance
sensors attached in the RC car. (drawing vehicle's movement and detected walls by vehicle)
- To stream real time video from iOS device screen.
